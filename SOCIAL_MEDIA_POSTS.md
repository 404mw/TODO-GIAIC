# Social Media Posts - Perpetua Flow

## LinkedIn Post

I've been quiet lately, but I was busy working on something exciting.

Just completed **Perpetua Flow** - my second entry in the SDD (Spec-Kit Plus) based Hackathon Series 2025-2026 launched by GIAIC.

**What is Perpetua Flow?**
A modern, AI-powered task management app designed to help users build lasting productivity habits through gamification and smart features.

**Key Features:**
• Smart Task Management with AI-generated subtasks
• Focus Mode for distraction-free deep work
• Consistency Streaks with grace day mechanics
• Achievement System with unlockable rewards
• Quick Notes with task conversion
• Smart Reminders with browser notifications

**Integrations & Services:**
• Google OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
• Checkout.com for payment processing
• Credits system for AI features
• Real-time notifications via Service Worker

**Technical Stack:**
• Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
• Backend: FastAPI, SQLModel, PostgreSQL
• State Management: TanStack Query v5, Zustand
• Testing: Jest, React Testing Library (80% coverage)
• Architecture: Spec-Driven Development (SDD-RI)

**Project Highlights:**
• 26+ routes implemented
• Production-ready build verified
• Fully responsive and accessible (WCAG AA)
• Complete OAuth flow with protected routes
• Secure payment integration for subscriptions

This project reinforced the importance of **specification-first development**. Starting with clear specs, planning architecture, and writing tests before implementation made the entire process smoother and more maintainable.

Huge thanks to GIAIC for organizing this hackathon series and promoting best practices in software development.
